Elements:
* Main generator of the floor - starting point.
* Doors - can be controlled when powered.
* Turrets? - shoot enemies (or maybe everyone) when powered.
* Enemies/monsters - will try to come towards player, requires quick reactions or working turrets.
* Secondary generators - either give extra power for main generator when turned on, or act as similarly to starting points.


To-do:
* ~~Walking guy~~
* Turrets
* Shooting turrets
* Keycards
* ~~Enemies~~
* ~~Chasing enemies~~
* Shooting enemies

Level ideas:
* Intro: power & open door, take keycard, open door with keycard, activate second generator (third door only reachable by it), open third door, exit.
* Maze-ish thing. Explore rooms looking for keycards.
* Enemies intro. Circular level structure, bait them around and trap them (close doors).
* Turrets intro. Enemies blocking the way, bait them towards generator where there are turrets.
* Activate second generator and connect to the first to increase reachable distance to reach final door.
